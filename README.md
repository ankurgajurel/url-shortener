Clone the repo and run 

```sh
docker compose up
```

Now, frontend is hosted in 

```localhost```

and backend is hosted in 

```locahost/api```

# URL Shortener with Flask, Next.js, and Postgres

This project is a full-stack URL shortener built with popular technologies:

## Backend: Flask and SQLAlchemy for a robust and scalable server.
## Frontend: Next.js for a modern and interactive user interface.
## Database: Postgres for reliable data storage.

It's easy to set up and use - just clone the repo and run docker compose up. The frontend runs at localhost and the API at localhost/api. Don't forget to add your database URI to the .env file!

This project showcases my skills in:
- Full-stack development: Combining backend and frontend technologies.
- Modern frameworks: Utilizing Flask, Next.js, and Postgres.
- Clean architecture: Separating server and client concerns.
